🎉🎉 Congratulations on your successful installation of TDEngine! 🫶🏿

## Install Shifu
you just need to use one command to install Shifu 😋
```bash
kubectl apply -f shifu_install.yml
```

## Run Shifu TelemetryService
First, you need to modify the value of  `spec/serviceSettings/SQLSetting/serverAddress` on  `devicedeploy/http-deviceshifu-telemetryservice.yaml`.
```yaml
--- #telemetry_service.yaml
spec:
  telemetrySeriveEndpoint: http://telemetryservice.shifu-service.svc.cluster.local
  serviceSettings:
    SQLSetting:
      serverAddress: 192.168.0.37:6041 # edit it to your your IP
      username: root
      secret: taosdata
      dbName: shifu
      dbTable: testSubTable
      dbtype: TDEngine

```
You can also change the dbTable to your table name in your TDEngine database, and of course you can change everything to what you want under SQLSetting. 🤗

Then, you can use the following command to install the telemetry service into your Kind cluster.
```bash
kubectl apply -f telemetryservicedeploy
```
🚀 Congratulations on your successful installation of Telemetry Service of Shifu! Flowing is the last Step you need to do. 👍🏿
## Run deviceShifu to Connect to Temperature and humidity meter
You can only use on command to start it, too 🐎。

```

# Enjoy the results of your work🕹
You can use the following command to access the TDEngine docker container.

```
Use the following SQL command to display the data you have collected.
